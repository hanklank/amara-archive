Quick Start
-----------

Amara uses [Docker](http://docker.io).  For ease of development, we use the docker-compose tool to have a full, production like, local dev environment.

1. Git clone the repository:

        git clone git://github.com/pculture/unisubs.git unisubs

   Now the entire project will be in the unisubs directory.

2. Get submodules.  There are two cases here:

   - For non-pcf employees, use the ./checkout-submodules public
   - For PCF employees and others with access to our private repositories, use
     the ./checkout-submodules all

**Note:** for either case, make sure that you have SSH access setup for github.
(https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

3. Install docker-compose (http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

4. Build the Amara docker image:

        bin/dev build

5. Configure Database:

        bin/dev dbreset

6. Start Amara Containers:

        bin/dev up


7. Add `unisubs.example.com` to your hosts file, pointing at `127.0.0.1`.  This
   is necessary for Twitter and Facebook oauth to work correctly.

   You can access the site at <http://unisubs.example.com:8000>.

To see services logs, run `docker-compose logs <service>` i.e. `docker-compose logs worker`

Testing
-------

To run the test suite:

        bin/dev test


Dev Notes
---------

To run a single `manage.py` command:

        bin/dev manage <command>

To see running services:

        docker-compose ps

To stop and remove all containers:

        docker-compose kill ; docker-compose rm

To view logs from a service:

        docker-compose logs <service>

To create an admin user:

        bin/dev manage createsuperuser
